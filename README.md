# LuanchKey-Mini-3-MIDI-for-DJay

File created using Algoriddim djay Pro AI for MAC but should work on all versions.

Controls:
Volume knobs control individual looper channels

Drum pads trigger start / stop of loop (only variants 1 & 2 of each as there aren't enough pads - also octave shift doesn't make any difference)

Pads are dim white when not playing and red when playing*

Pitch control = tempo control with spring back to centre

Modulation control = tempo control with no spring back

Play button = Play active deck

Record button = record

">" = start stop all selected loops


* I think lighting could be improved with better colour selection, not too much documentation on colour values. Found references here (though not this Novation product): https://www.partsnotincluded.com/how-to-control-the-leds-on-a-novation-launchkey-mini-ii/
